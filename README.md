## Valuation Methodology

### **1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**
- Based on historical data (2019â€“2024) and LTM 2025 performance.  
- Revenue growth and EBIT margins conservatively reduced by **2.5%** and **1%** respectively to account for future uncertainties.  
- Terminal growth rate (TGR) of **2%** reflects mature U.S. healthcare market growth.  
- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): **7.45%**.  
- Result: **Implied Share Price $525.82**, suggesting ~50% upside.

### **2. Comparable Company Analysis (Comps)**
Peers: **Cigna (CI)**, **Elevance Health (ELV)**, **Humana (HUM)**  
| Metric | UNH | Peer Median |
|:--|:--|:--|
| EV / Revenue | 0.9x | 0.5x |
| EV / EBITDA | 10.6x | 10.2x |
| EBITDA Margin | 8.3% | 4.1% |

Result: UNH trades broadly **in line with peers** despite superior scale, diversification, and earnings stability â€” supporting the DCF-based upside.
